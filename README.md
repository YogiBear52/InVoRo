# InVoRo
Influence by Interactive Rodmap Voting System (Think of a better acronym :P)

Any application has a Roadmap.
Any application want to get as much as feedback from their clients.

Why don't we expose our Roadmap?
Why don't we make our clients interactivly vote for their next most important features in our product's rodemap?

This porject will pack a plug and play e2e(configrable) frontened-backend-db system to expose in you website.
Design the component as you want.


Tech notes:
1. The server is using MongoDb. If you want to integrate with other Databases, you have to implement your own DB service provider.
2. The client component will be exposed as a WebComponent component.
3. The server will run on a docker container.
